<h1 align= "center"> REFLECTION</h1>

<p align="center"> There are many experiences, situations and challenges I have faced and conquered during my first quarter in ICT 9. Those include complicated lessons, hard to finish hands on's and very tight deadlines for passing projects, notes and assignments. Though those were hard to face, I managed to solve every single one of them byt thinking of the best possible solutions I could think of. Although, most of those won't be accomplished without my classmates, friends and most importantly, my ICT teacher, Ms. Uminga. These individuals has played a great role in helping me in acheiving my goals for this quarter. Without them, I wouldn't have done it all. Though there are some improvements I would like to accomplish for the next quarter. Those are, avoiding procastination, improved critical thinking, improved focusing skills, and most importantly, proper study habits. By accomplishing these, I would probably have a better grade than the previous quarter. And my only goal is to improve my grades every quarter.  </p>

<p align="center"> My name is Cairis Aisha M. De Castro, a student from IX - Fidelity of Las Pinas City National Science High School, Batch '24 - '25! I was born at exactly 6:03 PM on the 16th of February, 2010. A little more about myself is that I really like the color pink, Rose pink to be specific. As of now, I like OPM songs and usually play them whenever I study, do chores and... Anything I do I suppose. One of my favorites is RomCom - Rob Deniel and Dilaw - Maki. RomCom's already displayed in the home page so here's Dilaw in this page!! There are some pictures of myself attached there for you to know what I look like!!  </p>

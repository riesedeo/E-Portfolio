<p align="center"> My name is Cairis Aisha M. De Castro, a student from IX - Fidelity of Las Pinas City National Science High School, Batch '24 - '25! I was born at exactly 6:03 PM on the 16th of February, 2010. A little more about myself is that I really like the color pink, Rose pink to be specific. As of now, I like OPM songs and usually play them whenever I study, do chores and... Anything I do I suppose. One of my favorites is RomCom - Rob Deniel and Dilaw - Maki. RomCom's already displayed in the home page so here's Dilaw in this page!! There are some pictures of myself attached there for you to know what I look like!!  </p>

<p align="center"> To add, I have the best friend groups I could ever ask for. They're always there for me, whether be it good times or bad times, they're only one call away. I'm very grateful for them. My high school experience wouldn't be the same without them. Some special mentions, Pia Almazan, Iorick Dulay, Elisha Domondon, Lance Esliza, Eliana Perez, Raina Ramirez, Angel Santos, Rodilyn Tale, Raven Lanuzo, Sean Jordan and many more! They're the best! There are some pictures of us attached at the bottom! </p>
